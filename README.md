**Are you tired of forgetting important tasks in a game such as... daily rewards, world boss spawns, buff activation at the proper time and so on?**  
Or... are you finding hard to track all the tasks you want to do in-game?  
  
Black Spirit Helper can **solve your problem!** You can also set the application to start with your operating system to do not miss any task you want to do.  
**Black Spirit Helper offers** several features that can manage these things with multiple types of adjustable timers.  
Oh... I almost forgot to tell you, the application has **own overlay!** So, you can easily track your timers in-game without needs to switch to your desktop.
### Overlay?!#
Yes! Black Spirit Helper offers overlay! So, you do not need to switch to your desktop and then back to your game anymore! Enjoy your game comfortably without switching to system desktop.
### Is it legal to use?
Of course! Black Spirit Helper does **not** affect any game files. It does **not** track any screen events. It is just an advanced timer. I ask you... is Windows OS build-in timer illegal? It is in the same category as other software like [Discord](https://discordapp.com/), [TeamSpeak](https://www.teamspeak.com), etc. - For more info you can check [this](https://github.com/Frixs/BlackSpiritHelper/wiki/LegalUseProof) page!

## Features
### Timer Section
It offers you to create multiple groups with multiple timers in each. You can control each timer independently and you can also control multiple timers with group control.  
Custom overlay time to set, in-game overlay control, and much more! You can find it useful in all kinds of games where you need to track self-buffs/food-buffs/potion-buffs at the proper time.
### Schedule Section
This feature allows you to build your own schedule. Set timezone where you are currently - it recalculates time when you are abroad. Sound alerts and 3rd party message alerts (e.g. Discord).  
Very useful in any kind of games where you need to track down whatever at the proper time. The application can start with your operating system, so you will never miss any event again. Contains predefined templates of popular games, you do not need to create your own from scratch.  
Create your own templates with your own items that suit your needs!
### Watchdog Section
This feature checks your internet connection and it also checks your game's process to determine, if your game is running or sitting on the login screen (stuck in black/disconnection screen). Set alerts to inform you of what happened. Capable to set routine options to proceed on failure (e.g. shutdown your PC).  
It also offers manager to prioritize your game or kill unsuitable processes.  
Everything just to avoid game disconnections overnight!  
Based on what happens you can set events like send a message to your favorite platform to inform you about the situation or just simply shutdown/restart your computer.
### Screen Capture
The app allows you to select any opened window or simply the whole screen to capture it and display it in the app's overlay.  
The overlay does not interrupt you from mouse movement in your game, so you can watch your favorite movie, for instance, inside your game on the overlay surface without any issue.  
You can scale the overlay and make it transparent by your needs.
