**Are you tired of forgetting important tasks in a game such as... daily rewards, world boss spawns, buff activation at the proper time and so on?**  
Or... are you finding hard to track all the tasks you want to do in-game?  
  
Black Spirit Helper can **solve your problem!** You can also set the application to start with your operating system to do not miss any task you want to do, accidentally.  
**Black Spirit Helper offers** several features that can manage these things with multiple types of adjustable timers.  
Oh... I almost forgot to tell you, the application has **own overlay!** So, you can easily track your timers in-game without needs to switch to your desktop.
### Overlay?!#
Yes! Black Spirit Helper offers overlay! So, you do not need to switch to your desktop and then back to your game anymore! Enjoy your game comfortably without switching to system desktop.
### Is it legal to use?
Of course! Black Spirit Helper does **not** affect any game files. It does **not** track any screen events. It is just an advanced timer. I ask you... is Windows OS build-in timer illegal? It is in the same category as other software like [Discord](https://discordapp.com/), [TeamSpeak](https://www.teamspeak.com), etc.

## Features
### Daily Check Section
**Work in progress.** Set your custom message and Black Spirit Helper will notify you each time the timer is set to. You have only 2 options... say OK or notify me later. Elegant and simple. ...like a normal alarm clock.  
E.g. in [Black Desert Online](https://www.blackdesertonline.com), you can find it useful for daily boss scrolls pickup or guild daily reward.
### Schedule Section
This feature allows you to build your own schedule. It can be very useful in any kind of game where you need to track down special events at particular time. The application can start with your operating system, so you will never miss any event again. This section has already some predefined templates, so you do not need to create your own from scratch. For example, there are already predefined templates for [Black Desert Online](https://www.blackdesertonline.com) world boss spawns.  
The application allows to user to create his own templates with own items. This allows you to update your schedule according to your own needs.
### Timer Section
It offers to you to create multiple groups with multiple timers in each. You can control each timer independently, and you can also control multiple timers thanks to groups. You can find it useful in all kinds of games whre you need to track self-buffs/food-buffs/potion-buffs at proper time.
### Watchdog Section
This feature checks your internet connection, physical device input access and it also checks your game's process to determine, if your game is running or sitting in login screen (stuck in black/disconnection screen).  
Everything just to avoid game disconnections over night!  
Based on what happends you can set events like send a message to your favorite platform to inform you about the situation or just simply shutdown/restart your computer.
