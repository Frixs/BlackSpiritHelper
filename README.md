**Are you tired of forgetting important tasks in a game such as... daily rewards, world boss spawns, buff activation at the proper time and so on?**  
Or... are you finding hard to track all the tasks you want to do in-game?  
  
Black Spirit Helper can **solve your problem!** You can also set the application to start with your operating system to do not miss any task you want to do, accidentally.  
**Black Spirit Helper offers** several features that can manage these things with multiple types of adjustable timers.  
Oh... I almost forgot to tell you, the application has **own overlay!** So, you can easily track your timers in-game without needs to switch to your desktop.
### Overlay?!#
Yes! Black Spirit Helper offers overlay! So, you do not need to switch to your desktop and then back to your game anymore! Enjoy your game comfortably without switching to system desktop.
### Is it legal to use?
Of course! Black Spirit Helper does **not** affect any game files. It does **not** track any screen events. It is just an advanced timer. I ask you... is Windows OS build-in timer illegal? It is in the same category as other software like [Discord](https://discordapp.com/), [TeamSpeak](https://www.teamspeak.com), etc. - For more info you can check [this](https://github.com/Frixs/BlackSpiritHelper/wiki/LegalUseProof) page!
