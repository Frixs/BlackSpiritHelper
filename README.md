# Black Spirit Helper
**Are you tired of forgetting important tasks in the game such as... daily rewards, world boss spawns, buff activation at proper time and so on?**  
Or... are you finding hard to track all your tasks you want to do in-game?  
  
Black Spirit Helper can **solve your problem!** You can also set the application to start with your operating system to do not miss any task you want to do, accidentally.  
**Black Spirit Helper offers** several features that can manage these things with multiple types of adjustable timers.  
Oh... I almost forgot to tell you, the application has **own overlay!** So, you can easily track your timers in-game without needs to switch to your desktop.
### Is it legal to use?
Well, Black Spirit Helper does **not** affect any game files. It does **not** track any screen events. It is just an advanced timer. I ask you... is the Windows OS build-in timer illegal?
I will try to provide you official confirmation of legal use from [Black Desert Online](https://www.blackdesertonline.com) as soon as possible.

## Features
### Boss Section
**Work in progress.** Especially designed for [Black Desert Online](https://www.blackdesertonline.com). This is build-in version of online boss timer as you already know. It is implemented for you to have all-in-one. The application can start with your operating system, so you will never miss any boss again.
### Daily Check Section
**Work in progress.** Set your custom message and Black Spirit Helper will nottify you each time period you set. You have only 2 options... say OK or notify me later. ... like a normal alarm clock. Elegant and simple.  
In [Black Desert Online](https://www.blackdesertonline.com) you can find it useful for daily boss scrolls pickup or guild daily reward, for example.
### Timer Section
Offers to you to create multiple groups with multiple timers in each. You can control each timer independently, but you can also control multiple timer thanks to group. You can find it useful in all kinds of games whre you need to track self-buffs/food-buffs/potion-buffs at proper time.
### Watchdog Section
**Work in progress.** This feature controls your internet connection to avoid game disconnections over night. I did not think about the solution much yet. Also, the main goal is to make the application legal use. I will inform you about progress in this section in the future.
