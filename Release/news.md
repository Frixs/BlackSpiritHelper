## HELLO ADVENTURERS!
This week, a new update will come that brings a screen capture feature! With this feature, you can capture any screen or specific window and display it in the overlay. It can be very handy to watch movies while gaming etc.
<br/>
Because of that, higher requirements are set (Windows 10 1809).
<br/>

I hope you enjoy the feature!
<br/>
<br/>
This app is freeware and I created it for you guys, for the community. If you can, share it among your friends and let the app be useful to other people!
<br/>
Also, you can hit the donate button and make my spent time, I spent on the development., worth. I appreciate any kind of support. Thank you!
