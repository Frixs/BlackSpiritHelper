## HELLO ADVENTURERS!
APM Calculator is out now! I hope you enjoy this feature!
<br/>
This app is freeware and I created it for you guys, for the community. If you can, share it among your friends and let the app be useful to other people too!

Also, you can hit the donate button and make my spent development time worth. I appreciate any kind of support. Thank you!
